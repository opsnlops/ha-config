# Log to MQTT
#
#  "discovery" is false here because we use the HA API to talk to HA. MQTT is
#  for debugging purposes only.
#
#  Note that not all devices can handle this. The S31 plugs I have will reboot
#  if MQTT is enabled *and* you connect to them via the OTA logger. I guess
#  it's just too much for the small devices.
