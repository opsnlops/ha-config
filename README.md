# April's Home Automation Config

This is my config for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)!

We're an Apple household, so be sure and check out the HomeKit config!

## Hardware Used

### Server

A [Protectli](https://protectli.com) server running Debian Bullseye

### Zigbee

I use a [TubesZB](https://www.tubeszb.com) Zigbee Coordinator. I have the POE edition, and I keep it up to date with the latest version of ESPHome.

Most of the lights are [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com) bulbs.

### Z-Wave

I use a [Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 Z-Wave Hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X0AWA6E/) as the Z-Wave controller.

There's a healthy mix of Zooz and Inovelli Z-Wave devices, along with some others.

### ESPHome

My current efforts are on getting more and more devices moved to ESPHome! I use generic ESP32 boards, [Shelly 1 Relays](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1-smart-home-automation-relay/), and lots of Sonoff S31 plugs.
